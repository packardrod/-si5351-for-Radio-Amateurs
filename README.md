# -si5351-for-Radio-Amateurs
Design a simple VFO for Amateur Radio

I am a licensed amateur radio operator (WB9IWT) and have been so since 1972.  I am returning to my roots and the use of Morse Code. I would like to build a low powered CW transmitter controlled by Arduino with a simple sketch controling a si5351 clock.  In the process get back into simple programing.
